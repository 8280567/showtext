Title: Render text for R graphics devices using (almost) any fonts
Version: 0.1
Date: 2013-12-07

Description: This package can override text rendering functions of many
    R graphics devices (such as png(), pdf(), etc.), so that characters
    will be converted into lines and polygons and thus device independent.
    This will be helpful in situations when the device doesn't
    (well) support drawing Unicode characters (Chinese characters in
    pdf device, for example).
