Description: This package can override text drawing functions of many
    R graphics devices (such as png(), pdf(), etc.), so that texts
    will be converted to pure curves and thus device independent.
    This will be helpful in situations where the device doesn't
    (well) support drawing Unicode characters (Chinese characters in
    pdf device, for example).
Depends: R2SWF (>= 0.7)
